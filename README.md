# Sales-Forecasting-for-Retail-Store# Retail Sales Forecasting System
##  Features

- **Multiple Forecasting Methods**: Implements 4 different forecasting algorithms
- **Flexible Data Input**: Supports both sample data generation and custom CSV imports
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Comprehensive charts comparing historical data with forecasts
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Calculate MAE, MAPE, and RMSE for forecast validation
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple Python class with intuitive methods
- **Retail-Specific**: Designed with retail seasonality and trends in mind

##  Forecasting Methods

### 1. Moving Average Forecast
- **Description**: Uses the average of the last N days to predict future sales
- **Best For**: Stable sales patterns with minimal trend
- **Parameters**: Window size (default: 30 days)
- **Use Case**: Consistent product categories, mature markets

### 2. Exponential Smoothing
- **Description**: Gives more weight to recent observations while considering historical data
- **Best For**: Data with trend but no strong seasonality
- **Parameters**: Alpha (smoothing factor, default: 0.3)
- **Use Case**: Products with gradual trend changes

### 3. Linear Trend Forecast
- **Description**: Fits a linear regression to identify and project growth trends
- **Best For**: Businesses with consistent growth or decline patterns
- **Parameters**: Automatically calculated slope and intercept
- **Use Case**: Growing businesses, new product launches

### 4. Seasonal Naive Forecast
- **Description**: Repeats the pattern from the previous seasonal cycle
- **Best For**: Highly seasonal businesses with predictable patterns
- **Parameters**: Season length (default: 7 days for weekly patterns)
- **Use Case**: Restaurants, retail stores with weekly patterns
